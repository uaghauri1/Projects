Designing a packed bed reactor using MATLAB
The production of cumene involves the reaction between propylene and benzene with a side reaction producing unnecessary products. The temperature and
the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants and important metrics to consider. The plot shows the how the reactant is consumed and how the product is forming
at each point in the reactor. The temperature is in the secondary axis and it's variation is shows as well. 



## Masterfile
This is an Excel VBA program that extracts data from a DWSR (Daily Well Status Report). Everyday, a new excel file is generated showing the crude oil production
every day. The data can be hard to read so I developed a VBA program to extract the important data and create graphs showing production over a large period of time.
